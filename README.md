# Project Rock Paper Scissors Presents: RoPaSc

## A playable Rock Paper Scissors game in-the-browser!

You get to play against an A.I. where it will randomly select either object to use against you. Of course, you will be the first to choose and hope that whatever the A.I. selects, you will remain on top.

RoPaSc's main features include:

* Displays for both *You* and *A.I.* to see what you've chosen.
* A scoreboard.
* Buttons for the player to choose either object.
* An announcer/host to communicate what's happening.

Here's a preview of it in action!

Want to know how I built it? Check out the code for RoPaSc located in the **gui branch** of this repository.

## Wait, there is another version??

Yes. Though unlike the actual *RoPaSc*, you only get to play it through the developer console. Interested? Here's how to set it up: 

1. Clone this repository, specifically the **main branch**, into your computer. 
2. Set up both HTML and JavaScript files to your code editor.
3. Run the HTML file to display webpage.
4. A prompt will pop-up on the webpage but before you enter something:
    * Make sure to open the **Developer Console** to see the results of your input.
    * *Ctrl + Shift + I* or *Ctrl + Shift + J* on **Windows** and **Linux**.
    * *Ctrl + Option + J* on **macOs**.
5. There you go, you can now play RoPaSc (in-the-console)! 
    * Refresh webpage if you encounter any problems.
    * Also refresh webpage if the game is over.
